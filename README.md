```

- To run the backend, you first need to modify the `URI` param in `backend/.env`. The value of it is the MongoDB connection string. To create a new cluster to get the connection string, you can follow this [tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/clusters/mongodb-cluster-setup).

```
> cd backend
> npm install .
> npm start
```
